# AngularTourOfHeroes

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.5.
This is my first step into Angular 2+ world since the Angular team abandoned the poor AngularJs guys.

This is a desktop version of Angular Tour of Heroes built on top of [Election](https://electronjs.org/).
This simple [tutorial](https://malcoded.com/posts/angular-desktop-electron/) demonstrate how to wrap up Angular in Election and use native operating system resources.

## How to Run

Run `ng run election` to show the AngularTourofHeroes as desktop application
